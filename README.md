# AutoTab mod

## Description

Admins see you in spectator while you using cheats on server? This mod helps you a bit. Every time someone changes gamemode in spectator, you will hear a warning sound. Also it always displays tablist containing only spectator players. When the last player get out of spectating, you will hear another sound. Easy! See [quick demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zWq8NwZ83U) to see all these features.

## Install

It is a client-side mod. Move the _**.jar**_ file in your _**mods**_ folder.

## When the mod works?

I have tested it on LAN, on my spigot-local  server. Works fine. Seems  it work if server's core send information to client about spectator players. I think it's quite easy to bypass it and break  the mod :(
